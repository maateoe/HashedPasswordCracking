<h1>Hashed Password Cracking Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project documents the utilization of John the Ripper, a password-cracking tool, to decrypt a SHA-1 hashed password list. Through structured application of diverse word lists and rule sets, including masks tailored to common password patterns. This project is supposed to simulate brute-force and dictionary attacks techniques that are used for simple password attacks.
